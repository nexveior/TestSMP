## 🤔 What Is a Website?

A **website** is a collection of pages that people can open using the internet.

Examples:

A website can:
- Show information
- Promote your brand
- Collect messages
- Share links
- Look professional and trustworthy

## 🧠 How Does a Website Work?

Here’s the simple version:

1. Someone types your website link in a browser
2. The browser asks a **server** for your website files
3. The server sends those files
4. The browser shows your website on screen

That’s it.  
No magic ✨ — just files and the internet.
